# CAMBIO
Run a simple climate model to see how our CO2 emissions affect the atmosphere, land, and oceans.

## Description

CAMBIO is a simple climate model that demonstrates how key aspects of the Earth system respond to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. For given input scenarios, CAMBIO creates plots with time of:  
1) CO2 fluxes between humans and the atmosphere and between atmosphere and ocean and atmosphere and land.  
2) The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and ocean.  
3) Earth's albedo - that is, how much sunlight is reflected of Earth's surface. This decreases when ice melts, allowing the planet to absorb more sunlight and heat further.
4) The pH of the oceans, which is crucial for coral reefs and shellfish.  

CAMBIO has a variety of inputs that feed into the climate model. Some of these are tied to human choices, such as the year human CO2 emissions peak, while others represent guesses at how the climate will respond, such as the strength of the albedo feedback.

CAMBIO was originally developed for an undergraduate class on modeling Earth's climate. In the class, students develop the module piece by piece. Finally, when it is complete, they use it to study a particular aspect of the climate system. The CAMBIO web app allows anyone to run experiments with CAMBIO, to see how varying inputs lead to different responses.
